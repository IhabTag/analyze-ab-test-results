# Analyze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

## Project Scope

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Conclusions

**Because conversions may be the business north star metric and it's the most important revenue generating action the user may commit in the website, it worths the effort and time invested to improve it, and from the above data processing and analysis, we can conclude the following: -**

-   There was no evidence that neither the new landing page drives more conversions than the old landing page nor the country a user lives in has significant effect on coversions.
-   Due to the large sample size and the results from various types of tests that were run on it, stopping the experiment and keeping the old landing page is recommended.
-   Developing a new landing page to run another experiment may be a good idea.
